#create conda env(preferred) or virtualenv if you do not have one
#also can be done from pycharm
#with Project:ubertool selected; Files-> (Default) Settings ->Project Interpretor
#click gear and then create conda env or virtualenv
#name: env; location: ~/git/qed/ubetool (where you cloned the repo)
# python version 2.7
#this directory is already git ignored in the repo

#either manually conda install requirements.txt dependencies
#or wait for pycharm to recognize and install

#for conda env not all packages will be installed, use the command line and
#activate the virtual environment from the repo directory
#for best results use git scm command line editor in windows
./env/Scripts/activate
#and then
pip install whatever_package_conda_didnt_install
#for packages that say pip install in requirements.txt

#back end models are exposed via the ubertool_ecorest
