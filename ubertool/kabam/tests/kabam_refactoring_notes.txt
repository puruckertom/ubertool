The following notes apply to the process of conducting the kabam unittests and
integration tests.

1. Original spreadsheet for kabam input variables listed 'kg_phytoplankton'; it appears that
   this variable is defined as 'organism growth rate constant' (based on Expression for
   'pesticide tissue residue for sinlge trophic level'); it is noted here because the value
   of this variable for all other trophic levels is calculated in the model based on the
   wet weight of the species at the trophic level  --  because there is no input for the
   wet weight of phytoplanton I'm assuming the value for the growth rate is appropriately
   included as an input value (Just noticed in documentation that wet weight of phytoplankton
   is not applicable - Table 5 of Kabam User's Guide)

2. The mammal and bird diets are inputs in the OPP model spreadsheet, however they have been
   hardcoded in this version of the python model (methods 'wet_food_ingestion_m_f' and
   'wet_food_ingestion_a_f'). These have been moved out of the methods and assigned in the
   main routine.  Eventually they should be accessible to the user as inputs as they are in
   the OPP model spreadsheet.  The methods mentioned above also calculate the total wet weight
   of the diet per mammal/bird by multiplying the percentages of the diets by the percentage of
   water in the each diet item.  This will be left in the method.  Finally, the names of the
   individual mammals/birds used in the model should be added to the input; these are assigned
   now in the main routine along with the diets.

3. The variable "kG: aquatic animal/organism growth rate constant" is not included in the
   input variable list of the spreadsheet along with other constants such as k1, k2, kE,kM.
   The question is simply should it be included in the "ModelInputs" class, or maybe the
   "ModelOutputs" class.  Should the user be allowed to specify it as an input?

4. The mammalian chronic endpoint risk measure may be input with units of ppm or mg/kg-bw.
   A new variable 'mammalian_chronic_endpt_unit' has been added to the Kabam input list to
   contain the units string.  Appropriate if-then construct is placed in code to ensure
   correct processing of variable value.

5. Alert: There are output variables listed in Table 15 of the OPP spreadsheet model that are
          not accounted for in any of the pre-existing python codes (i.e., kabam.py,
          kabam_functions_original.py).  They include  chronic_dietary_based_toxicity_mammals
          (equals input value associated with mammalian chronic endpoint  -- needs conversion
          for assignment to output depending on input units of ppm or mg/kg-bw),
          acute_dietary_based_toxicity_avian (equals input value associated with avian_lc50  --
          may need assignment to output variable), and chronic_dietary_based_toxicity_avian
          (equals input value associated with avian_noaec  --  may need assignment to output
          variable).

6. Alert: Method 'acute_rq_diet_mammals' requires chemical specific input 'mammalian_lc50'.
          This input variable may be input as 'N/A' (Table 3: meaning not available rather than not applicable).
          In the case of a 'N/A' the output variable 'acute_rq_diet_mammals' is assigned 'N/A' in the OPP
          spreadsheet (Table 16). This doesn't work well in the python code because numpy arrays need to be homogeneous
          in datatype so, for now anyway I recommend that the appropriate cell in the ubertool input spreadsheet
          be blank rather than inserting a 'N/A'; the blank will be processed in the code as 'nan' rather than 'N/A'
          and thus the resulting value of 'acute_rq_diet_mammals' will be 'nan'.
