The following notes apply to the process of conducting the kabam unittests and
integration tests.

1. Original spreadsheet for kabam input variables listed 'kg_phytoplankton'; it appears that
   this variable is defined as 'organism growth rate constant' (based on Expression for
   'pesticide tissue residue for sinlge trophic level'); it is noted here because the value
   of this variable for all other trophic levels is calculated in the model based on the
   wet weight of the species at the trophic level  --  because there is no input for the
   wet weight of phytoplanton I'm assuming the value for the growth rate is appropriately
   included as an input value (Just noticed in documentation that wet weight of phytoplankton
   is not applicable - Table 5 of Kabam User's Guide)

2. The mammal and bird diets are inputs in the OPP model spreadsheet, however they have been
   hardcoded in this version of the python model (methods 'wet_food_ingestion_m_f' and
   'wet_food_ingestion_a_f'). These have been moved out of the methods and assigned in the
   main routine.  Eventually they should be accessible to the user as inputs as they are in
   the OPP model spreadsheet.  The methods mentioned above also calculate the total wet weight
   of the diet per mammal/bird by multiplying the percentages of the diets by the percentage of
   water in the each diet item.  This will be left in the method.  Finally, the names of the
   individual mammals/birds used in the model should be added to the input; these are assigned
   now in the main routine along with the diets.
