1. In the OPP Ted spreadsheet; in the worksheets named 'Min rate doses' and 'Max rate doses' under
   columns M and N, the allometric parameters for amphibians and reptiles daily total water consumption are
   a2=.065, b2=.726, and c2=3.7.  The value for c2 should be 1.0 according to Table A 1-7.7.
   The value of 3.7 is associated with 'Other birds not in Passeriformes order'.
2. Same spreadsheet/worksheet/columns as #1.  The allomeric parameters for dietary intake for amphibians
   are a1=.301 and b1=.751.  The values listed in Table A 1-7.5 for reptiles and amphibians are
   a1=.013 and b1=.773.  IT LOOKS LIKE ALL VALUES OF ALLOMETRIC PARAMETERS SHOULD BE VERIFIED.
3. Dermal equivalency factor (for use in Eq 13 of Attachment A 1-7): The equivalency factor is the
   ratio of the LD50(oral) to the LD50(dermal).  Eqs 14&15 are used to compute the factor for birds using
   LD50(oral) data for birds; Eq 14 is used to compute the factor for mammals using LD50(oral) and LD50(dermal)
   data for rats.  For amphibians it appears that the factor is assumed equal to 1 and used directly
   in Eq 13.  Confusion comes up about reptiles; the text in Attachment 1-7 seems to state that the
   same Eqs for birds are to be used for reptiles but the code (TED Excel spreadsheet) appears to
   take the same approach for reptiles as taken for amphibians.
4. In worksheets "Min/Max rate - dietary conc results" exceedances are determined for terrestrial invertebrates
   in soil for the large mammals (column K), while NA is assigned to the small mammals.  Is this correct or
   should large mammals also be NA?  As coded here at the moment the large mammals is also assigned 'NA'.
5. In worksheets "Min/Max rate concentrations" it appears the EEC calculations for small mammals, large mammals,
   small birds, and small terrestrial phase amphibians or reptiles contain wrong values for the (1 - FWk) factor.
   For mammals, the FWk represents the water content of the short grass that mammals consume.  From Table A 1-7.4
   the water content of short grass (actually Grasses in the table) is 0.79, which would make (1 - .79) = .21, the
   worksheets have a value of 0.2 for this (not so far off).  For small birds and small terr phase amphibians the food
   source is insects (arthropods) whose water content is 0.69, thus (1 - 0.69) = .31, again the worksheets have a
   value of 0.2.
