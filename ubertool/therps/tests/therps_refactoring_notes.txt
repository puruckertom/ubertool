Name Change Notes:

1. Input variable names are changed to be consistent with those used in "trex_exe.py".
   In making the name changes the description of the variable was used to determine name change.
   In some cases (below) the meaning is a bit less than definitive

    a) What was labeled "bw_avian_ld50" is changed to "tw_bird_ld50"; the "t" seems to
       mean "tested" but the description is not explicit on this.  I went with the name
       used in "trex_exe.py" for the given description.  This is true for other input
       variables that begin with "bw_avian"

    b) references to "avian" were changed to "bird" for consistency with "trex_exe.py"

    c) application rate, num_apps, and app_interval are used to create function that
       converts these into object/series like those used in TREX; the output of the converter
       are objects containing num_apps, application rate per application, and application day
       of year per application
